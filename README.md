# yoto-playlist-automations

This application processes a list of media links (such as Youtube videos) and downloads each file to a folder so it can be uploaded on a DIY Yoto card. Notion makes it easy to have a running todo list of songs or other items to put on a card and this automation conveniently downloads each file and converts it to an mp3 for you.

### Steps to run locally

Download the latest [https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases](yt-dlp) binary and put it in the root of this project. You might have to run `chmod +x yt-dlp` after that.

I tried installing it with Homebrew but it doesn't appear to work at the moment.
